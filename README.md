# C Learning Journey

This repository tracks my progress learning C programming.

## Goal
Learn C from the ground up, including basics, control flow, functions, data structures, and practical projects.

## Folder Structure
- `basics` — Hello world, variables, input/output, types
- `control-flow` — if, switch, loops
- `functions` — defining and calling functions, recursion
- `data-structures` — arrays, pointers, structs, linked lists
- `projects` — small programs and projects

## How to use this repo
- Start from `basics` and work your way down.
- Add code files in the appropriate folder.
- Commit often with meaningful messages.
